# Percolation-Simulator
An advanced interactive 3D simulation of liquid percolating through soil.
<br><br>
<b>Tools:</b>
* OpenGL
* Processing (https://processing.org/)
* Java Swing (UI Library)
***
The user can control a 3-dimensional block that is composed of "open" and "closed" sites. Water can flow through the open sites, but not through the closed ones. The block's width/height/depth can be fully customized, and the user can determine the <b>P value</b>, or the probability that a given site is open or closed. High P values imply more percolation, while low P values imply less percolation.
