# Percolation Simulator
An advanced and interactive 3D simulation of liquid percolating through soil.
<br><br>
<b>Tools:</b>
* OpenGL
* Processing (https://processing.org/)
* Java Swing
***
The user can control a 3-dimensional block that is composed of "open" (white blocks) and "closed" sites (brown blocks). Water can flow through the open sites, but not through the closed ones. The block's width/height/depth can be fully customized, and the user can determine the <b>P value</b>, or the probability that a given site is open or closed. High P values imply more percolation, while low P values imply less percolation.

After generating the block, the user can play an animation of the water percolating through it. In addition, the user can take apart the layers of the block to see the percolation inside.
